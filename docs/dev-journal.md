## 2026-07-12 — #172 Historical Month Navigation refactor (close-out)

Worked the `24-history-navigation-refactor` plan end to end across 21 commits,
cheapest → highest-blast-radius, each leaving the frontend suite green. The
feature shipped `HistoryChart` as a deliberate **sibling** of the Dashboard's
`TrajectoryHorizon` (design log 23 deferred the shared-chrome extraction to a
future refactor plan). This was that plan: the two charts shared, essentially
byte-for-byte, a month-label helper, the series interface + builder, the whole
visibility block, the toggle-chip legend, the series-toggle indicator, and ~13
styled components. All of it is now extracted into the correct layers and
consumed by both charts, which keep only their divergent `<ComposedChart>`
bodies.

**New shared layers.** `hooks/useSeriesVisibility` (the `hooks/` directory's
first resident — the "used across 2+ features" rule) bundles the
`useState`(defaults + persisted-merge) + `useEffect`(save) + toggle/isolate/
showAll handlers, composing the pure math already in `utils/trajectory`.
`utils/trajectory` gained `buildSeriesDescriptors` (+ the `SeriesDescriptor` /
`SeriesColors` / `SeriesAccount` types) and a loosened `computeVisibleYDomain`
row type (`ChartRow`) that deleted HistoryChart's `as unknown as
TrajectoryDataPoint[]` cast. Four dumb, chart-agnostic `components/` were added
and barrel-registered: `SeriesLegend`, `SeriesToggleIndicator`, `ChartFrame`
(card + header with a `controls` slot + loading state), and `ChartTooltip`
(the box + label shell; each chart still renders its own rows as children).

**Month-name dedup.** Both charts and `MonthYearPicker` each carried a private
copy of the month-name array despite `utils/format` already exporting an
identical `formatMonth`/`MONTHS`. Exported `MONTHS` and routed all three through
it — one source of truth.

**ChartFrame boundary — a deliberate narrowing of the plan.** The plan listed
the chart _wrapper_ as part of `ChartFrame`, but the wrapper carries
feature-specific test affordances (`data-testid`, History's `data-months`) and
wraps feature-specific chart content, so pulling it into a domain-agnostic shell
would leak feature test concerns. `ChartFrame` therefore owns card + header +
loading-or-children; each feature keeps its own trivial `StyledChartWrapper`,
and the feature's empty-state stays in the feature (passed as children). The
card's top margin is a `topSpacing` prop (defaults to the Dashboard value) so
History's slightly smaller gap is preserved rather than silently changed.

**Legend testIds preserved.** `SeriesLegend` takes a `testId` prop so both
charts keep their existing `history-legend` / `trajectory-legend` hooks — the
existing `HistoryChart` / `TrajectoryHorizon` behavioural suites stayed green and
untouched across every adopt commit, which is the proof the extraction preserved
behaviour. Also swept out the already-dead `StyledTooltipRowAccent` (unused
before this refactor).

**Test note (unchanged from prior close-outs).** The full `vitest run` still
shows the 33 `server/*` failures from the `better-sqlite3` NODE_MODULE_VERSION
mismatch (the native module is built for Electron, not Node — `npm rebuild
better-sqlite3` to run the server suite). This refactor is entirely frontend;
every `src/` test passes, plus 24 new tests across the six extracted modules.

## 2026-07-07 — #155 Real Bank CSV Import refactor (close-out)

Worked the `22-real-bank-csv-import-refactor` plan end to end across eight
commits, low-risk → high-risk, each leaving `npx vitest run` green. Two latent
drift risks removed from the parse engine, plus a parsing-consistency fix, two
mechanical module renames, and two isolated Import-wizard UI fixes.

**Dead `detectEncoding` (drift risk, not just a tidy-up).** `parse.ts` still
exported the old BOM-or-Windows-1252 guesser, the barrel re-exported it, and
unit tests pinned it — but production encoding had moved to `detectStatement`'s
`hasUtf8Bom` + signature-driven retry, and the UTF-8 BOM byte constant lived in
two files. Deleted the function, its constant, its re-export, and its tests;
the statement-detection retry is now the single encoding authority (same
subtraction the #20 refactor did for `detectBank`).

**Hand-synced `preset.columns` (drift risk).** Production parsing derives
columns from the file's actual (de-duplicated) header and never read
`preset.columns`; the field survived only because two tests asserted the parsed
columns _equalled_ it, and the Postbank-CC `Betrag (2)` name had to be
hand-written to mirror the runtime de-dupe. Dropped the field from the
interface and all four presets, and re-pointed the two tests to assert against
the real fixture header literal (ground truth).

**Parsing consistency.** Extracted the copy-pasted record-builder
(`buildRecord`) shared by the known-bank parser and the generic fallback, and
brought the known-bank header **de-duplication** to the generic path — an
unknown bank shipping two identically-named columns now addresses distinct
cells instead of collapsing them (RED test first). Generic **encoding** stays
Windows-1252: no header signature exists to act as the "decoded correctly"
oracle, so a generic encoding retry would be a guess (design log 21, Q7).

**Module renames.** `detect.ts` → `flagRows.ts` (row-level flagging against
account history) and `preview.ts` → `detectStatement.ts` (statement/bank
detection); the preview _orchestrator_ keeps its already-correct name
`buildPreview.ts`. Exported symbol names unchanged, so the barrel and the
imports route were untouched — only intra-library imports and test imports moved.

**UI fixes.** The Account-step filename now truncates with an ellipsis + hover
`title` (a missing-truncation bug — any width could be overrun), and the
review body's fixed 320px cap became `min(56vh, 620px)` so a normal screen
shows ~12 rows before the internal scroll takes over.

**Out-of-scope observation.** On a clean `main` (before this refactor),
`RecurringTransactionModal.test.tsx > pre-selects the existing category by name
and saves it unchanged when editing` fails deterministically — `onSaved` is
called with `category: ""` instead of the pre-selected `"Housing"`. Unrelated
to CSV import; left untouched. Worth a separate look: it is a real assertion
failure, not a flake. (Also note: the server test suite only runs once
`better-sqlite3` is rebuilt for the Node ABI — `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`;
it is otherwise built for Electron and every SQLite-backed test fails with a
`NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch.)

## 2026-06-25 — #147 Month Year-Comparison refactor (close-out)

Worked the `21-month-year-comparison-refactor` plan end to end across ten
commits, cheapest → riskiest, each leaving the full suite green. Five
independent cleanups behind the shipped year-over-year card:

**Dead route mapping.** The reports route hand-rebuilt `YcAccountEntry` /
`YcTxEntry` objects from the storage DTOs before calling the library. The
storage `Account` / `Transaction` types are already structural supersets of
those input interfaces, so the `.map(...)` blocks were a no-op copy — deleted,
DTO arrays now pass straight through.

**`parseYearMonth` helper.** Extracted the open-coded `value.split("-")`
month parser into `lib/date/date.ts` with its own test (handles both `YYYY-MM`
and `YYYY-MM-DD`). `computeYearComparison` adopts it. `lib/projection` and
`lib/settlement` still carry their own copies — deliberately out of scope to
keep the blast radius small; they're noted future adopters.

**Named server Variable-Spending rule.** `computeYearComparison` inlined the
"drop transfer legs and auto-settlement" predicate and owned a private
`NON_SPENDING_KINDS` set. Both now live in `lib/variableSpending/` as
`isVariableSpending` (transaction predicate) and `selectSpendingAccounts`
(account-kind selector). `src/` and `server/src/` are separate build targets
and can't share code, so the client's `selectVariableSpending` in
`src/utils/monthStats` and this server copy are knowingly duplicated — a parity
comment on the module pins them together. Future `/reports` cards reuse the
server helper instead of re-inlining.

**Hook failure path.** `useYearComparison` did `fetch().then(r => r.json())`
with no `res.ok` guard and no `.catch` — a 500 or dropped connection left the
card spinning forever. It now mirrors `useMonthTransactions`: an `error` field,
an `ok` guard, a `.catch`. The card threads `error` through `MonthOverview` and
renders an honest one-line message, a branch distinct from its empty state.

**Narrowed query (`findByDateRange`).** The route loaded the entire
transactions table via `findAll()` then let the library discard everything
outside a two-year window. Added `findByDateRange(fromInclusive, toExclusive)`
to the `TransactionsRepo` contract — a half-open `date >= ? AND date < ?
ORDER BY date` query mirroring the per-account month finder — covered it in the
shared storage parity spec, and pointed the route at a two-year span computed
from `?month`. The library is unchanged and still re-filters, so this is a pure
data-load optimization that cannot alter the rows.

**No contract change.** Endpoint URL, `?month` parameter, response shape,
ranking, and cap are all untouched. The only frontend-visible change is the new
`error` field on the hook.

## 2026-06-22 — #143 Bank Statement Import refactor (close-out)

Worked the `20-bank-statement-import-refactor` plan end to end across twelve
commits, low-risk → high-risk. Cleanup clusters first: deleted the dead
`detectBank` path (`locateKnownBank` is the only detection source); extracted a
shared `formatFileSizeKB` util and reused the `Money` primitive in the wizard's
raw preview; lifted the preview orchestration into a pure, fixture-tested
`buildPreview()` and thinned the route to transport; extracted `useImportWizard`
so `ImportWizard.tsx` is composition over presentation; and aligned naming —
`Import` → `ImportRecord` in the data layer, `desc`/`cat` → `description`/
`category` in the UI (deleting the `toParsedRow` / `toImportedTxn` translation
layers).

**Consistency pass — a latent defect, not just a tidy-up.** The generic
fallback labelled every unrecognized statement `DEFAULT_BANK = "DKB"`. Because a
commit remembers its preset keyed by bank label, a single generic import
silently overwrote the _real_ DKB account's remembered column mapping. Renaming
the fallback to `"Generic"` (commit 10) closes that — a distinct label can never
collide with a real bank's preset memory.

**Preset round-trip fixed.** Migration 011 had collapsed `import_presets` to
`(bank, mapping)`, dropping the `delimiter`/`decimal`/`date_fmt` the engine needs
to re-interpret a statement; a "remembered" preset restored only column _names_
and re-derived format quirks from the freshly detected bank. Migration 012
widens the table (forward-only, German-default backfill) and the full preset now
round-trips: the preview echoes the effective format, the wizard sends it back
on commit, and `buildPreview` re-applies a remembered preset's decimal/date
format when mapping rows. The delimiter is persisted for completeness but not
re-applied — detection still owns splitting, so a remembered delimiter has no
consumer yet.

## 2026-06-16 — #138 Phase 6 + 7: Modals + acceptance sweep (refactor close-out)

Finished the visual-fidelity refactor. The Transaction Edit modal was the only
modal needing a real rebuild; the rest were already faithful or needed small
polish.

**Transaction Edit modal → `08` (full fidelity).** New reusable
`primitives/ChoiceChip` (label + active + optional colour dot + disabled) drives
both the Direction toggle and the Category picker. The modal now uses the
`Modal` title/footer slots (Delete · Cancel · Save changes), an "On ● account"
context line, Description, an Amount + Date two-column grid, an editable
**Direction** (Outflow/Inflow → amount sign), and editable **Category** chips.
Transfer legs stay read-only (Save hidden, fields disabled, two-leg note).
`transactions.category` stores a category **name** (the server's in-use check
matches `transactions.category = category.name`), so chips key off names and
colour via `colorForCategoryName`. The modal gained an `accounts` prop (wired
from `MonthOverview`) to resolve the source account's name + colour.

**Import Wizard (`07`) — already faithful.** Verified all three steps (Account
→ Map columns → Review) render 1:1 against the screenshot; it shipped complete
with the Import UI. No change.

**Mortgage / Account-Create — toggle polish only.** Origination fields + the
live `% paid off` preview (MortgageModal) and the showInTrajectory field
already existed. Polished the "Display in Trajectory Horizon" control from a raw
checkbox to the prototype's bordered card: `TrendingUp` icon box (gold when on)

- title + description + the `Toggle` primitive on the right (hidden for
  Mortgage).

**Import history defaults expanded.** The year accordion now opens the most
recent year by default (was all-collapsed), matching `05`.

**Acceptance sweep — typography drift.** `FormField` labels were sentence-case
14px; the prototype uses the small uppercase label scale for every field. Moved
`FormField`'s label onto `typography.scale.label` (11px, uppercase,
letter-spacing) — purely visual (`text-transform`, so the DOM text and all
`getByLabelText` tests are unaffected), bringing every modal's field labels to
the prototype.

**Known minor deviation (deferred):** the Edit/Create amount inputs don't render
the prototype's inline `€` prefix — the `Input` primitive has no prefix slot and
adding one is out of this refactor's scope.

## 2026-06-16 — #138 Phase 5: Settings recomposed to the prototype

Brought the Settings screen's Preferences and About cards to the canonical
layout, reusing existing primitives and adding two small reusable pieces.

**New shared components.** `SettingRow` (components/) — the prototype's
icon-box + title/desc + right-slot row, used for every preference line — and
`BrandMark` (components/) — the sun-arc logo SVG extracted out of `AppLayout`'s
sidebar so it can be reused in the About card. `BrandMark` takes a `label` prop:
labelled it is an accessible `img`, unlabelled it is decorative (`aria-hidden`),
so the sidebar mark stays the named graphic and the About mark doesn't duplicate
the accessible name on the page.

**Preferences card** (`features/settings/PreferencesCard`): three `SettingRow`s
— Automatic updates (wired `AutoUpdateToggle`, now reduced to just the
primitive Toggle), Appearance (`Dark` badge), Privacy (`Local` pos badge).

**About card** (`features/settings/AboutCard`): `BrandMark` + product
description + tech line, and a VERSION label / mono version / "Check for
updates" button. `AppVersion` (the old "Horizon x.y.z / Electron …" stack) was
removed — the prototype shows the app version alone, no Electron line.

**"Check for updates" wiring.** There is no dedicated check-for-updates IPC and
adding one is out of scope, so the button surfaces the _current_ update state
via the existing `useUpdateStatus` + snackbar: a Download action when an update
is known available, a Restart action when one is downloaded, otherwise an
honest "You're on the latest version (vX)" info toast. Because `AboutCard` now
uses `useSnackbar`, the page test wraps the page in `SnackbarProvider` (as
production already does via `AppLayout`).

**Out of scope, confirmed by the plan.** The prototype's "Snackbar states"
preview card stays dropped (decision doc); the Storage card keeps showing the
_real_ DB path/size, not the prototype's mock `2,4 MB`.

## 2026-06-16 — #138 Phase 4: Account Detail recomposed to the prototype

Rebuilt the Account Detail screen to the canonical hero layout: `AccountHero`
(Avatar in the account colour, name + account-colour status dot, kind Badge,
subtitle, ghost Edit + danger Delete, and a CURRENT BALANCE / RESTSCHULD
StatBlock with a balance Sparkline), `AccountStatStrip` (Opening Balance,
Opening Date, Recurring, Recurring net / mo — sibling of `MonthStatStrip`), a
`SectionHead` + "Add recurring", and a reskinned `RecurringTransactionList`
(NAME | AMOUNT | DAY | FREQUENCY, the transfer target as a "→ ● account"
sub-line, frequency as a Badge).

**Two prototype elements had no real-data field; resolved by deriving from what
exists (developer-approved this session):**

- **Hero subtitle.** The prototype's `a.sub` ("Savings · 1.2% APY · ST reserve")
  is hand-authored and the account model has no such column (no new schema in
  scope). `accountSubtitle` derives a per-kind line instead — "Checking/Savings/
  Investment account", "Mortgage · Restschuld", and "Credit card · settles
  monthly → <funding>" for a linked card.
- **Balance sparkline.** The prototype hardcodes the series; `accountBalanceSeries`
  reads the account's month-by-month balance from the projection snapshots
  (actual over projected). Honest forward trend — the line is the account's real
  trajectory, so a Tagesgeld with an annual Sondertilgung shows its real dips.

**Inline editing dropped.** The old header's inline rename / opening-balance
fields are gone; the hero's Edit opens the existing AccountCreateModal (edit
mode), which already covers name + opening balance + every other field. The
delete guard (blocked while the account has one-off transactions) and a confirm
step are preserved — the prototype's delete-with-Undo toast is a separate epic.

## 2026-06-16 — #138 Phase 3: Month Overview acceptance pass (1:1 with prototype)

Drove the real app (seeded with the prototype's Nov-2026 accounts + variable
spending) and diffed the render against `screens/03-month-overview.png`. Three
fidelity gaps closed; the screen now matches the prototype:

- **Spending list order.** Rows were grouped by account then descending (a side
  effect of `useAllMonthTransactions` concatenating per-account API results).
  The prototype lists a month oldest-first, interleaving accounts — so
  `SpendingList` now sorts the visible rows by ISO date ascending (presentation
  only; the shared hook is unchanged).
- **Category colours pinned to the prototype.** Colour was purely name-hashed
  (#134), so the donut + badges rendered arbitrary hues. Added a fixed
  name→colour map for the seven canonical breakdown categories
  (Groceries=sage, Dining=clay, Transport=steel, Shopping=lilac, Health=teal,
  Cat=ochre, Misc=slate), hash fallback for any other name. Applied identically
  to the frontend util and its server mirror; every fixed value is still a
  member of `categoryColorPalette`.
- **Donut centre rounded.** Added an opt-in `whole` option to `Money` and a
  `wholeCenter` prop on `Donut`; the breakdown centre now reads `776 €` like
  the prototype while the legend keeps cents.

**Developer decisions (this session).** Avg/day stays `daysInMonth` (the
functionally-correct -25,87 €, not the prototype's hard-coded /28 = -27,72 €).
Category colours moved from pure-hash to fixed-map for the known categories
(reversing the #134 "purely from name" stance for these seven, by request).

## 2026-06-15 — #138 Phase 3: Month Overview recomposed to the prototype

The Month Overview screen was rebuilt from the old per-account ledger into the
canonical prototype layout: PageHeader + month stepper, a 4-card stat strip
(`MonthStatStrip`), the `SpendingList` (All-accounts + per-account tabs with
counts, day-number rows, category badges, account dots), the `MonthBreakdown`
donut, and an honest `YearComparison` "Planned" placeholder (no fabricated
bars, per design-log decision #6). New pure utils: `deriveMonthStats`,
`deriveBreakdown`, and a frontend `colorForCategoryName`.

**Category colour — pure util, not a /categories fetch.** Every category colour
in the system is `colorForCategoryName(name)`: SQL-seeded defaults fall back to
it at read time and user-created categories persist exactly that value on
insert (the server never stores a custom colour — there is no colour picker).
Resolving colour from the transaction's category name on the frontend is
therefore provably identical to reading the `color` column, with no network
round-trip for a purely visual concern. The palette mirrors the server's.

**Variable Spending excludes transfers + auto-settlement.** The spending list
and all stat/breakdown figures filter out one-off transfer legs (`transferId`)
and credit-card auto-settlement (`isAutoSettlement`) — they are bookkeeping
movements, not spending. Consequence: a one-off transfer created from the Month
Overview no longer appears in its list (the prototype's "Add expense" is
expense-only; the create modal still exposes the transfer picker, unchanged).

**Deliberate deviation — Avg / day denominator.** The prototype hard-codes
`totalSpend / 28`; `deriveMonthStats` divides by the actual calendar days in
the month (`daysInMonth`). On the prototype-calibrated seed this is the one
figure that differs from the reference screenshot (June: -25,87 € vs the
prototype's -27,72 €). The seed reproduces every other number to the cent. This
is the functionally-correct choice; flagged for the developer to veto.

**Minor known difference.** The shared `Donut` centre renders cents
("776,16 €") where the prototype shows a rounded "776 €". The per-slice legend
matches the prototype exactly (cents shown). Left as-is rather than changing the
phase-0 `Donut` API.

## 2026-05-04 — SQLite Driver refactor close-out (issue #65)

Eight leaks plus the missing-other-half restore feature from the SQLite
Driver shipping (issues #62–#64) are now closed before the Electron shell
slice begins.

**Wire prefix.** Storage routes drop the `/api/` segment that #62/#63
introduced as a local anomaly. Every other domain mounts at `/<domain>/*`;
storage now does too. SPA helpers and the consolidated route file follow.

**One router per domain.** `routes/storageStatus.ts` and
`routes/storageBackup.ts` are now a single `routes/storage.ts` mounted
once at `/storage`. The two `__tests__/storage*.route.test.ts` files
collapsed into one `storage.route.test.ts` along with the route.

**Unsupported-driver action returns 400, not 501.** The Mongo path of
`POST /storage/backup` previously returned 501 with `{"error":"not
supported"}` — but `sanitize5xx` blanket-rewrote that to
`{"error":"Internal server error"}` in the Cloud Build, so the legitimate
"this driver doesn't support backup" case looked like a server crash. The
route now uses an `isUnsupportedDriverError` predicate that maps the
literal `"not supported"` message to a 4xx body
(`Storage driver does not support {backup,restore}`); other throws
propagate to Express's error middleware unchanged.

**Required `path` for SQLite.** `createStorage("sqlite")` no longer
silently defaults `path` to `:memory:`. A missing `path` throws
`SQLite storage driver requires a 'path' option` at boot. The Electron
entrypoint (when it lands) must read `HORIZON_DB_PATH` and pass the
resolved file path explicitly. Tests pass `":memory:"` themselves.

**Restore endpoint + UI.** `POST /storage/restore` accepts a multipart
`file` upload (multer), writes it to a unique temp path under
`os.tmpdir()`, calls `storage.restore(tempPath)`, and unlinks the temp
file in a `finally`. `StorageIntegrityError` maps to 400 with one of two
stable messages (`Backup file failed integrity check` /
`Backup was written by a newer version of Horizon`). The Settings →
Storage UI gains a "Restore from backup" button (SQLite only) that opens
a hidden file input, shows a confirm dialog naming the file, and surfaces
the server error on failure.

**Integrity helpers.** `connection.ts`, `migrate.ts`, and
`SqliteStorage.ts:validateRestoreSource` previously each ran their own
`PRAGMA integrity_check` / `user_version` comparison with subtly
different error message shapes. They now share
`storage/sqlite/integrity.ts` (`assertIntegrity`, `assertSchemaNotAhead`).

**Settings UI realignment.** The status display + action buttons live in
`features/settings/StorageStatus/` (`.tsx`/`.styles.ts`/`.test.tsx`).
`SettingsStoragePage` is composition-only: heading + `<StorageStatus />`.
Tests split into one-file-per-unit-of-behaviour: `useStorageStatus.test.ts`,
`downloadBackup.test.ts`, `uploadRestore.test.ts`, `StorageStatus.test.tsx`,
plus a smoke test on the page. Meridian theme tokens cover all storage UI;
no raw HTML semantic elements unstyled.

**What's next.** The Electron shell (design log 10) builds on top of
this: a daemonised Express child process, `app.getPath('userData')`
wired into `HORIZON_DB_PATH`, and a Settings-page integration of the
open-path's `StorageIntegrityError` envelope (today the Express child
would crash at boot — the shell will need to handle it).

## 2026-05-01 — Repository Abstraction refactor close-out (issue #54)

Six leaks left over from the Repository Abstraction shipping (issues #51–#53)
are now closed before the Desktop Build slice begins.

**Wire format.** Routes now `res.json` Storage DTOs directly. The `_id` shim
is gone from every route and the SPA reads `id` end-to-end. There is no
backwards-compatibility window — Horizon has one client and the rename was
mechanical. `lib/projection.ts` accepts the same DTO shape (`id`, not `_id`).

**SQLite foreign keys.** Migration `002_foreign_keys.sql` rebuilds
`transactions`, `recurring_transactions`, and `milestones` with `REFERENCES
accounts(id)` (no cascade — application-level guards fire first and produce
409s). `migrate.ts` enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` for every connection
before pending migrations run, since the pragma is per-connection in SQLite.

**Account delete.** Both drivers' `accounts.delete` now reject deletion when
recurring transactions (active _or_ inactive, on `accountId` _or_
`linkedAccountId`) or milestones still reference the account. The route
maps `{ ok: false, reason: "in_use" }` to a 409 with reason-specific copy.

**Recurring create.** Both drivers' `recurringTransactions.create` validate
`accountId` and (when provided) `linkedAccountId`, returning `null` for
unparseable or unknown ids — same contract as `milestones.create`. The
repo's return type is now `Promise<RecurringTransaction | null>`. The route
surfaces `null` as 404.

**What changed for callers.** Tests that previously POSTed against a fake
account id now have to create a real one first. `FAKE_ACCOUNT_ID` is gone
from `recurringTransactions.test.ts` and the storage-only Mongo recurring
test. Wire format flipped from `_id` to `id` — anything reading the SPA's
network responses externally would need to update.

## 2026-04-19 — `monthOfYear` schema migration (recurring transactions)

Added optional `monthOfYear` (integer 1–12) to the `RecurringTransaction` Mongoose
model as part of the financial projection dashboard refactor (issue #36).

**Why:** Annual recurring transactions previously had no way to specify which month
of the year they fire. `deriveSTMonths` fired them at the projection-start month
offset (`i % 12 === 0` from `fromMonth`), which was always wrong for ST payments
intended for October.

**Migration strategy:** Forward-compatible additive field. No migration script.
Existing records without `monthOfYear` continue to fire at the projection-start month
as before. Users with existing annual recurring transactions will see correct ST month
placement only after they open and re-save the transaction — at which point
`monthOfYear` is persisted. `deriveSTMonths` explicitly falls back to the old
behaviour when the field is absent.

**What to watch:** If a user has an October ST stored as an annual RT created before
this change, it will still fire at the projection-start month until re-saved.
Consider surfacing a one-time prompt to re-confirm ST month after this ships.

## 2026-06-15 — #138 Outlook accordion: projected vs actual Restschuld

While restructuring the Projection Accordion (issue #138) the collapsed/expanded
Restschuld column was switched to read the **projected** balance only, not
`actual ?? projected`. A Mortgage's `actual` is just its un-replayed opening
balance (ST is a recurring transfer, never an actual transaction), so when the
mortgage's `openingDate` is in the past, the replay-derived projected start
(e.g. 72.000) differs from the opening balance (90.000). Mixing them fabricated
a phantom Restschuld step-down at the current-month boundary.

**Out-of-scope observation:** the Dashboard KPI "Restschuld" tile and the
MortgageCountdown still use `actual ?? projected`, so they show the opening
balance (90.000) while the accordion/trajectory show the projected start
(72.000). Both are defensible (account balance vs modelled trajectory) but
inconsistent across screens. A future consistency pass should pick one
convention for "current Restschuld" project-wide.

## 2026-07-14 — In-app dialogs for menu actions (supersedes design-log 24 update-messaging)

Refactor plan 25 (issue #180) moved the native Windows message boxes that the
application menu used for **result notifications** and **destructive
confirmations** into in-app Horizon UI: success/info become transient
snackbars, errors become a blocking `AlertModal`, and the Start-Fresh /
Restore-overwrite prompts become a danger-tone `ConfirmModal`. Manual
"Check for Updates" outcomes (checking / up-to-date / error / dev-unavailable)
now flow through the existing `useUpdateStatus` / `UpdateBanner` machine
instead of native boxes. File pickers, the fatal startup dialog, and About
stay native by necessity/choice.

**Supersedes a recorded decision:** design-log `24-native-application-menu.md`
deliberately chose native message boxes for the update up-to-date / error /
dev-unpackaged outcomes. Design-logs are immutable snapshots, so that log is
left untouched; **this entry is the record of the reversal.** The split it
created — an available update surfaced as an on-brand snackbar while
"you're up to date" popped a grey Windows dialog — is what this refactor
removes.

**Plan deviation (commit 8):** the plan's commit 8 introduced the `main.ts`
IPC helpers (`notifyRenderer`, `confirmViaRenderer`) as a dormant, unused
commit. The electron tsconfig enables `noUnusedLocals`, which rejects unused
module-level functions, so a truly-dormant helper commit cannot build. The
helpers were instead introduced in the commit that first uses each one —
`notifyRenderer` with createBackup (commit 9), the confirm infrastructure with
restoreFromBackup (commit 10) — which keeps every commit building and leaves no
dead code. Net result is identical to the plan.

**No leftover native code to delete:** because each action's wiring commit
(9–12) rewrote its handler to delegate to the extracted orchestrator, it
removed its own `showMessageBoxSync` calls inline. By the cleanup commit the
only native boxes remaining are the intended ones — the fatal startup dialog
and About.

**Out-of-scope observations:**

- `src/features/import/ImportWizard/ImportWizard.test.tsx` >
  "commits the category created inline during review…" is flaky under full-suite
  load (passes in isolation and on re-run). Pre-existing, unrelated to this
  refactor. Worth stabilising separately.
- Every renderer test that needs `window.horizon` builds its own inline mock of
  the full bridge. Extending the bridge in this refactor forced edits across
  seven test files. A shared `makeHorizonMock(overrides)` factory would make
  future bridge changes a one-line update; deferred to keep this refactor within
  the plan's scope.

## 2026-07-15 — #185 Savings Streak goal editor: Milestone mode + convert-on-edit (feature close-out)

Closed out the Savings Streak feature (PRD #181, slices #182–#185) with the
Milestone half of the goal editor. Milestone mode takes one total amount + one
target month and shows the derived per-account split **live and read-only** in
the same row list Manual mode uses. No new math: the split is
`computeSavingsGoal`'s trailing-12-month positive average-gain weighting, ported
whole in slice 1 — the modal just re-runs it as the user types and reads back
`.monthly`. That let this slice land with zero changes to the engine and its
already-green tests.

**Weighted by savings pace, not balance.** The handoff prototype split the
milestone by _current account balance_; its own `DELTA.md` flagged this as wrong
(balance and monthly movement are unrelated — a balance-weighted split produced
targets no account could consistently hit, a permanently-red streak). Both copy
strings the DELTA called out — the card's milestone summary caption and the
modal helper text — now read "by each account's recent savings pace". The tests
assert both the presence of that phrasing and the _absence_ of "by balance", so
the old copy can't quietly return.

**Convert-on-edit.** Editing any row while in Milestone silently switches the
goal to Manual, pre-filled with the current derived split, so overriding one
account never discards the others. Implemented with two composed functional
`setEuros` updates: `switchToManual` replaces the map with the derived split,
then the row handler overrides the edited id on top of it — order-independent of
React batching, no `useEffect`.

**Points plumbing.** The Milestone split needs the reconstructed history, so
`useSavingsGoal` now also returns `points`, `DashboardPage` threads them into
`SavingsStreakCard`, and the card forwards them to the modal. The prop is
optional end-to-end (`points = []`), so Manual-only render paths and the existing
card tests that never open Milestone are untouched.

Full suite green (1896 tests), `tsc -b` clean. README and the CLAUDE.md roadmap
now mark Savings Streak complete.

## 2026-07-15 — #186 Savings Streak refactor: split the engine, align to conventions

Structure-only pass over the Savings Streak compute layer (refactor plan
`docs/refactor-plans/26-savings-streak-refactor.md`). No behaviour, schema,
route, or data-contract change — the `016` migration, `SavingsGoalRepo`, the
`GET`/`PUT /savings-goal` routes, the balance-delta "met" signal, and every
rendered string are exactly as shipped. Six commits, each independently green
(`npx vitest run` + `tsc -b`).

**Module moved to where its siblings live.** `computeSavingsGoal` was the lone
pure financial-compute function sitting under `src/features/` while every other
one (`projection`, `trajectory`, `outlook`, `mortgage`, `monthBreakdown`,
`recurring`, …) lives in `src/utils/<name>/`. It moved to
`src/utils/savingsGoal/savingsGoal.ts` via `git mv` — same exported name, same
`(config, points, trackableIds) => SavingsGoal` signature — with the exhaustive
24-case test moving alongside it, unedited, as the safety net. The move
introduces the codebase's first `import type` from `features/` into `utils/`
(`HistoryPoint` and the savings config/derived shapes); accepted as **type-only**
(erased at compile time, no runtime coupling), since the clean alternative —
relocating those types into `src/types/` — would ripple through the whole
history feature and is explicitly out of scope.

**One 140-line procedure became a thin orchestrator over private helpers.** The
five jobs the body did in one scope — resolve monthly targets, derive
per-account cumulative progress, scan monthly-met, count current/best streak,
build the Jan→Dec strip — are now single-purpose private functions
(`milestoneSplit`, `manualTargets`, `derivePerAccount`, `scanMonthlyMet`,
`currentStreak`, `bestStreak`, `buildYearTicks`) plus small `parseMonth` /
`monthsBetween` / `lastMonth` / `balanceOf` primitives. Tested only through the
public function — the Fowler ideal, matching how `outlook` and `monthBreakdown`
keep internals private and assert on external behaviour.

**One shared export, not a re-run of the whole engine.** The Milestone
trailing-12-month weighting is the single helper with a genuine second consumer
— the goal editor's live preview, which previously built a throwaway `milestone`
config, ran the entire `computeSavingsGoal`, and kept only `.monthly`. That
weighting is now the exported `milestoneSplit(targetTotal, targetDate, points,
ids)`, called directly by both the engine's Milestone branch and the modal's
`useMemo`. The split is a single source of truth and gets its own direct test
(exported utils owe one).

**Formatting folded back onto `utils/format`.** The card was hand-rolling a
12-entry long-month array (dup of `MONTHS_LONG`), a `formatTargetMonth` (dup of
`formatMonthLong`), a `.slice(0, 3)` short-name derivation (dup of the exported
short `MONTHS`), and a whole-euro currency formatter. Added `formatEuroWhole`
beside `formatBalance`, exported `MONTHS_LONG`, and the card now uses `MONTHS`,
`MONTHS_LONG` / `formatMonthLong`, and `formatEuroWhole` — no local copies. The
short `MONTHS` entries are identical to `long.slice(0, 3)` for all twelve
months, so the tile labels render the same strings.

**Out-of-scope observations:**

- `src/features/import/ImportWizard/ImportWizard.test.tsx` >
  "commits the category created inline during review…" remains flaky under
  full-suite load (passes in isolation and on re-run). Still pre-existing and
  unrelated — same flake noted in the #180 native-dialogs entry. Worth
  stabilising on its own.
- `SavingsGoal extends SavingsGoalConfig` mixes the persisted and derived shapes
  in one interface. Left untouched; a possible future tidy, not this refactor.
- The unrelated local `MONTHS` arrays in `Clock` and `ImportHistory` are the
  same smell in different features — left for their own refactors.

## 2026-07-18 — #197 Import Review Repair refactor: consolidate the review surface

Post-build tidy-up of the Import Review Repair feature (issues #190–#195),
following refactor plan `docs/refactor-plans/28-import-review-repair-refactor.md`.
Behaviour-preserving throughout: no rendered text, commit payload, error
contract, API, or schema change. Six commits, each leaving the full suite green
(`npm run test`) and `tsc -b` clean; the existing suites (`reviewRows.test.ts`,
`importErrors.test.ts`, `useImportWizard.test.ts`, `ImportWizard.test.tsx`) are
the regression net and pass untouched, extended only with a `pluralize` case set
and one `summarizeReview`-from-`flags` case.

**`flags` is now the sole source for the summary counts.** `summarizeReview`
counted the raw `r.duplicate` / `r.recurring` / `r.pending` booleans, bypassing
the `flags` array the whole feature is built on — the exact drift the array was
introduced to kill (the original `pending` bug). It now counts
`r.flags.includes(...)`, so a future change to `flagsFor` moves the summary with
it. A pinning test asserts the summary tracks `flags`, not the booleans.

**One tested `pluralize` helper replaced five copy-pasted ternaries.**
`${n} noun${n !== 1 ? "s" : ""}` appeared four times in `ImportWizard.tsx` and
once each in `ImportView.tsx` and `ImportHistory.tsx`. `pluralize(count,
singular, plural?)` now lives in `src/utils/format` beside `formatBytes` and the
month formatters, returning the joined `"<count> <word>"` pair, with its own
singular / plural / explicit-plural tests. The blocked-rows pill keeps its
inverse verb agreement (`need` / `needs`) as an explicit local expression — only
the noun goes through the helper, since verb agreement is a special case that
belongs at its one call site, not in a general noun helper.

**Tone and icon per flag are declared once.** The three review-summary badges
re-declared the icon and tone that `FLAG_BADGES` already held for the per-row
badges. They are now one `RowFlag`-keyed `FLAG_SPECS` table carrying
`{ label, tone, Icon, summaryLabel(count) }`, iterated in `FLAG_ORDER` over the
non-zero counts. The per-row and summary badges read the same source; the two
can no longer drift.

**The review table is a co-located presentational component.** The head + body
(~70 lines of the ~540-line wizard) lifted into
`ImportWizard/ReviewTable/ReviewTable.tsx` with its own `ReviewTable.styles.ts`
(the review-table styled components moved out of `ImportWizard.styles.ts`).
`ReviewTable` takes `rows`, the `toggle` / `setCategory` / `setDescription`
handlers, a `registerDescRef` registrar, and the `flagSpecs` table as props; it
owns the `FlagSpec` contract it renders. All orchestration state — inclusion,
`everBlocked`, `attentionOnly`, `blockedRows`, the jump cursor — stays in
`ImportWizard`, because the footer pill and Import button depend on it. The
extraction is presentational only, not a state split. The shared `StyledFlagBadge`
stays in `ImportWizard.styles.ts` (the summary uses it too) and `ReviewTable`
imports it from the parent.

**Verification.** `ImportWizard.test.tsx` drives the whole wizard through the
real `ImportWizard → ReviewTable` composition with a fetch mock, and its #190 /
#193 blocks already exercise the plan's end-to-end scenario: a blank-description
row renders an editable input, is marked invalid with a fix-me placeholder, is
counted by the blocked-rows pill, clears its error the moment a description is
typed, and commits the typed value. Full suite (1983 tests) green, `tsc -b`
clean.

**Out-of-scope observations:**

- ESLint flags three pre-existing `react-hooks` errors in the import feature
  (two `set-state-in-effect` in `ImportWizard.tsx`'s `everBlocked` /
  `attentionOnly` effects, one `refs` in `useImportWizard.ts`'s
  `mapRef.current = map` during render). They predate this session and are
  unrelated to the consolidation; husky runs prettier only, so they never gated
  a commit. Left for their own pass — behaviour-affecting fixes that need their
  own tests, not this behaviour-preserving refactor.
- The knowingly-duplicated validity rule (`blockersFor` vs `ImportRowSchema`)
  and the server tier's own `describeImportIssues` pluralization are untouched,
  per the plan — the tier boundary can't share the frontend `pluralize`.

## 2026-07-18 — #196 History Page composition: compose the orphaned chart + archive

Completed the History page composition the history-navigation design log (23,
issues #168–#172) already specified but never wired, following refactor plan
`docs/refactor-plans/27-history-page-composition-refactor.md`. Phases 3 and 4
shipped `HistoryChart` and `YearArchive` fully built and fully tested, but
`HistoryPage` never advanced past its phase-2 skeleton: it rendered only the
header and, when there were no imports, an `EmptyState` — and rendered nothing
in the empty state's place once imports existed. Both components were imported
by nobody. No change to `HistoryChart`, `YearArchive`, or `useHistory`'s public
shapes; only `HistoryPage` (and its test) change. Three RED→GREEN test/feat
pairs, each collapsed into one green commit (the plan permits pairwise collapse;
a knowingly-failing RED commit would break the every-commit-green rule — RED was
demonstrated by running each new test before implementing).

**The page now composes two hooks, the `DashboardPage` pattern.** `HistoryChart`
needs the account list for its per-account series, so the page calls
`useAccounts()` alongside `useHistory()` and passes `accounts` down — exactly how
`DashboardPage` feeds `TrajectoryHorizon`. `useHistory` was deliberately not
extended to fetch accounts; that would duplicate `useAccounts` and give the hook
a second responsibility. The chart receives `isLoading={false}` because the page
gates on a top-level spinner before it mounts.

**Four explicit page states, gated in order.** loading (shared `Spinner`, early
return like `DashboardPage`) · error (a distinct `EmptyState`) · empty (the
existing "No history yet" `EmptyState`, no-imports only) · content (chart +
Year Archive). The gate order is what closes the bug the plan targets: on a
failed fetch `useHistory` degrades `years` to `[]`, so the old `isEmpty` check
rendered "No history yet" — a fetch error masquerading as an empty state. The
error branch is now checked before empty, so a failed load reads as
"Couldn't load your history," never as "no imports."

**Layout is pure composition.** Header → chart → Year Archive, matching the
canonical prototype (`docs/handoff/history-navigation/prototype/src/screens/History.jsx`).
Both children self-chrome (the chart via `ChartFrame`'s card, the archive via its
own `StyledArchive` section), so the page adds no `Card` wrapper — the same way
`DashboardPage` renders `TrajectoryHorizon` directly. Range chips, legend, and
series visibility stay internal to `HistoryChart` (per refactor 24's
`ChartFrame` adoption); the page holds no chart state.

**Verification.** `HistoryPage.test.tsx` was extended, not replaced — the header
/ empty-state / CTA tests stay green and unmodified. Its `mockFetch` now stubs
`/accounts` (the page's new call) and the suite asserts what the user sees across
all four states: the chart (`history-chart` testid) and the Year Archive with a
year row render on load, a pending fetch shows the spinner (`role="status"`), a
failed fetch shows the error state and specifically **not** "No history yet," and
a no-imports response keeps the empty state. `HistoryChart.test.tsx` and
`YearArchive.test.tsx` remain the regression nets for the composed pieces (the
latter covers each month row's `/months/:month` deep-link). Full suite (1987
tests) green, `tsc -b` and `eslint` clean.

**Further note.** This was the third "built-but-not-composed" gap in the history
feature's wake; the end-to-end verification step is the guard that would have
caught it originally — a passing unit suite did not, because the old "loaded
state" test asserted only the _absence_ of the empty state, never the _presence_
of content. The extended suite now asserts presence.
